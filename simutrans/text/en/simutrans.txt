<title>Prologue</title>

<h1><strong>Welcome to Simutrans-Extended</strong></h1>

<p>
Essential to every functioning economy is transport, and essential to transport are the transport pioneers through the ages who forged roads, canals and railways through difficult terrain, established shipping routes accross the high seas, or built aircraft to transport people and goods through the skies at hitherto unprecedented speeds; pioneers such as the Duke of Bridgewater, whose eponymous canal triggered Britain's canal age, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who drove a railway line from London to Bristol, or Frank Whittle who devised a new means of aerial propolusion that brought in the jet age.
</p>
<p>
In Simutrans-Extended, you have the chance to be a transport pioneer yourself, connecting people and industry accross a virgin unconnected land of your own choosing, either alone, or with others from all over the world on one of Simutrans-Extended's persistent multi-player servers where game worlds last for real life years and game centuries.
</p>
<p>
Play thorough hundreds of years of transport history from 1750 to the present day, from sailing ships and horses to steam trains, motor cars and aircraft. Connect the world and and then keep your network up to date as cities grow, new industries spring up and old ones close down and new forms of transport replace the old, and, in online games, competitors change or improve their networks. Will your canals survive competition from railways? Will your railways survive competition from roads? Will your ships survive competition from aircraft? Will towns be clogged up with congestion or will skilful road design and good mass transit provision keep people and goods moving in even the densest of metropolises? 
</p>
<p>
Play big or play small - alone on a map size of your choosing, from the size of a small island to that of a whole country, or, in an online game, dominate a giant transport empire, or provide a small niche transport service to a particular locale. How you play is in your hands; but the rule of thumb is always: if it worked in the real world, it should work in Simutrans-Extended.
</p>
<p>
Take passengers and mail to where they want to go and in good time; take goods to where they are called for according to the contracts between producers and consumers. Industries need workers, towns need working shops, shops need customers, customers need products to buy, and factories producing products need raw materials. Connect towns and industries and watch the world flourish from your efforts.
</p>
<p>
So long as your transport company remains solvent, you can carry on transporting people, mail and goods through the ages and into the future. 
</p>
<p>
May your transport company have a prosperous future and may the land that it serves flourish as a result.
